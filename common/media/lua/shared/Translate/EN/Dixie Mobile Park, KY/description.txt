<LEFT> <SIZE:small> If you are searching for a home - permanent or not - why not try Dixie Mobile Park? Housing here is very affordable and despite being just a 'simple' trailer park, some services are right around the corner, from a food market to a laundromat and diner. And you can always travel to Muldraugh and West Point for more thanks to the nearby Dixie Highway.<LINE><LINE>
However, the main thing we excel at is community. We are home to a diverse group of people, from Korean War and WWII veterans to tradesmen who settled here temporarily before moving on to their next gig. Every weekend, locals fire up the grill for a BBQ, and everyone’s invited — whether you live here or not. So why don't you visit on a Friday night, have fun with some friendly folks, and maybe consider moving here? Just don't forget to bring some beers!
