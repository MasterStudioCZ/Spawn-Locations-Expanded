<LEFT> <SIZE:small> Is Riverside becoming too expensive? Do you want to live a simpler life with a tight-knit community, yet maintain close access to amenities and services? Are you here only temporarily? If you answered 'yes' to any of these, then why not consider moving to the Scenic Grove Mobile Home Park?<LINE><LINE>
Nestled among lush forests right off the Kentucky 163, the trailer park is close both to nature and opportunities, with Riverside being just north and Brandenburg a few miles to the west. Need work but can't commute? You're in luck - the nearby Lectromax Manufacturing plant is currently hiring both skilled and unskilled workers!
